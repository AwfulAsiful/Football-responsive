                                <p>Throughout its 45 editions, the Copa América had just two trophies. The oldest, called America's Cup, was made in 1916 and 1917 in Buenos Aires by Casa Escasany Jewelry and watchmaking, at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Argentina to be donated to CONMEBOL.
                                    <br>
                
                                The trophy is made of silver and has transient possession. It means that there is no condition for it to remain definitive with a champion national team. His wooden base with the plates of the champions countries was added in 1979, in the edition won by Paraguay.
                                <br>
                                The second trophy was produced specifically for the Copa América Centenario, in 2016. Designed by Epico Studios, the cup was manufactured by the English Thomas Lyte in metal, with an internal silver finish and gold plated on the outside. The definitive possession remained with the champion Chile</p>
